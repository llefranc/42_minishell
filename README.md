## About

Minishell is the 6th project of the mandatory part of the cursus.
It's only made in C and the main goal was to create a shell working like bash.
In this case we had to understand how processes, redirections, pipes, execve and bash builtins work.
We also had to learn how bash was handling a command line (lexer / parser / exec).

- Here is the [subject][2]

`This project was code for MACOS`
